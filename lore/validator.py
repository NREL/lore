# import validity definitions for variables

# data sent to the validator must be labeled so the specific validation criteria can be used

# Django uses a SQLite dastabase by default. "In contrast to many other database management systems,
#   SQLite is not a clientâ€“server database engine. Rather, it is embedded into the end program."

# The Python Standard Library includes a module called "sqlite3" intended for working with this database.
